**Description**

**Gross Margin:**

Gross margin is the difference between a company's revenue and its cost of goods sold (COGS). 
It shows how efficiently a company produces and sells its products.

                                        Gross Margin = Revenue − COGS

It focuses on the core activities of production and sales, ignoring other costs like operating expenses, taxes, and interest.

**Net Profit:**

Net profit is the amount of money a company retains after all expenses, including operating costs, interest, taxes, and other non-operating expenses, have been deducted from revenue.

                                      Net Profit = Revenue − Total Expenses

It gives a complete view of a company’s profitability, taking into account all costs and income.

The **sales team** focuses on gross margin because it directly relates to the revenue from sales and the cost of producing goods or services.

The **marketing team** focuses on net profit because they need to evaluate the overall effectiveness of their strategies in driving profitable growth, factoring in all business expenses.
